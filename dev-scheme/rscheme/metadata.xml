	  RScheme is an implementation of the Scheme language, with
	  it's object-orientation approach adapted from the Dylan
	  language. RScheme implements all of R4RS except
	  transcript-on and transcript-off, and all of R5RS except
	  define-syntax (RScheme still employs it's own the hygienic
	  syntactic extension facility with analagous but not
	  compatible metasyntax to R5RS's define-syntax).
